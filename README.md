# hello-world
First repository

Hi peeps!
My first repo and first edit on GitHub, the code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
Repo is the way one organizes a project.
Branching is the way of working on different versions of a repo at the same time.
Commits are saved changes in the repo.
